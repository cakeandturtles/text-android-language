# text-android-language

(.txt)
language designed to be used primarily with google keyboard.
make common case fast and easy

x is 3 instead of x = 3 (flows better, less keystrokes, don't have to switch keyboard screen)

indentation: use spacebar from google keyboard, ide will interpret spaces at beginning of line as tabs (???)
  define foo with x:
   x is x * 2
  end foo

newline to separate instructions, or "." to separate instructions on same line

  x is 3. y is 4
  z is 5
  w is 6
  
  

(.htxt) html like (jasmine like?) easy android screen layout editor
plugs into text-android easily.

ex: hello.htxt
hello, world

  (will be interpreted as correct xml android screen layout)
